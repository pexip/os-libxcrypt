### Disabled policies

# The rationale for prohibiting boolean 'grep' is sensible
# (it doesn't short-circuit, which could be a huge waste of time)
# but the recommended alternative is 'any' from List::MoreUtils,
# which would be the only CPAN dependency we had.

# them up would only obscure the logic.

# diagnostic triggers on perfectly sensible code.

# that it gets written to (and read from) implicitly, but that's not
# possible.

# of consumers.
